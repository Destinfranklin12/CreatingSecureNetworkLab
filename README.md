 ### [Lab Presentation Video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xZxPnIknPb-VTrF5t_QtARpb9dAeCX22/view?usp=share_link)

<h2>Lab Scenario</h2>
You have been hired by an IT company as an IT subject matter expert. Management has a client who
wants to upgrade their IT systems, but the client has a limited budget and no more physical space to
install new equipment. You suggest implementing virtual machines instead of more hardware to help
reduce costs and to meet the client’s operational needs. Part of the upgrade includes installing a
Firewall, a PC for the CEO, an internal Webserver, an internal DNS server, and some Linux machines for
monitoring and conducting cybersecurity related tasks. Once the new network is installed, you will
document configurations and create a security baseline by scanning for open ports.
